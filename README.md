This is a __collection__ of custom libraries, created as a way of grouping together functions I've written as implementation exercises over the past few years. Some of the functions have prototypes that are identical to their __C Standard Library__ counterparts, while others may have some alterations. There are even some functions I've added that are not found in the C Standard Library.

The 'ml_' prefix serves to differentiate between functions that are custom implementations written by me and those that belong to the __Standard C Library__.
