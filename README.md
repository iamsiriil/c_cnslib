# myclib
 
 This is a custom library, created as an exercise. Some of the functions have prototipes that follow their original C standard librarie's counterparts, others may have some alterations, and some are altogether new.
 
 For the time being, this project includes simpler, non optimized versions of the functions found in the original C Standard Library.
